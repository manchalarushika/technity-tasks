1)The value [] is an empty list that contains no values, similar to '', the empty string.
2)we can  assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam as 
   spam[2]='hello'
   Assuming spam contains [2,4,6,8,10] after the assigment,it will become [2,4,'hello',8,10]
3) spam[int('3'*2/11] evaluate to 'd'  
4) span[-1] evaluate to 'd'
5)span[:2] evaluate to ['a','b']
6)bacon.index('cat') evaluate to 1
7)bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True,99].
8) bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like [3.14,11,'cat',True]
9)The operator for the list concatenation is +,while the operator for replication is *.
10)the difference between the append() and insert() list methods is while append() will add values o
